// Working with Multi-Dimensional Arrays. Write a Java program to create a 2D Array and 
// Copy the 2D Array into a single dimension array
// Hint => 
// Take user input for rows and columns, create a 2D array (Matrix), and take the user input 
// Copy the elements of the matrix to a 1D array. For this create a 1D array of size rows*columns as in 
// int[] array = new int[rows * columns];
// Define the index variable and Loop through the 2D array. 
// Copy every element of the 2D array into the 1D array and increment the index
// Note: For looping through the 2D array, you will need Nested for loop, 
// Outer for loop for rows, and the inner for loops to access each element
